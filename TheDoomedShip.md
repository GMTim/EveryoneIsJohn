# The Doomed Ship

### Tag Line
You wake up to the sounds of dripping, and waves splashing against the hull. You look around and see you are in a small cabin with a large closed door and a small port hole window looking out at a stormy sea. Looking down, you see you are kneeling in front of a pentagram. Within the pentagram is a dead chicken who's guts are splayed on the floor. You are wearing dark robes soaked through with blood, and are holding a wicked looking dagger in one hand, and a leather bound book in the other.
